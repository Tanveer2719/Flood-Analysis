# üáßüá© Bangladesh Geospatial Terrain and Environmental Dataset

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Overview

This [dataset](/combined%20Data.csv) contains **1,571 spatial sample points** across Bangladesh, each annotated with key geospatial, topographic, hydrological, soil, and lithological features. The data was generated using Google Earth Engine by sampling various remote sensing products and earth observation datasets.

## üìç Geographic Coordinates

Each row contains:
- `latitude`: Latitude of the sample point (WGS84)
- `longitude`: Longitude of the sample point (WGS84)
